### An Elderly Care and Safety App

Within the Age Guardian suite, there are two primary applications: the User App and the Guardian App. These applications work together to deliver a comprehensive and technologically advanced solution, ensuring the overall well-being and safety of elderly individuals.

1. The User App provides a range of crucial features and acts as the main interface for senior citizens.
2. The purpose of the Guardian App is to provide guardians and caregivers with up-to-date information on the wellbeing of senior users.

The "Age Guardian" project serves as an example of how well data analytics, cloud-based services, and cutting-edge sensor technology can be combined. 
Accurate real-time health monitoring was achieved utilizing accelerometer data for respiratory rate computation, camera data for heart rate monitoring, and gyrometer sensors for fall detection. 
User decision-making is improved by the inclusion of a fuzzy logic system for risk assessment that is based on meteorological and health data.
The utilization of Amazon DynamoDB for data storage and AWS SQS for asynchronous communication demonstrates the scalability and dependability of cloud services in a practical setting.
